# Expository Writing

When describing a system's architecture or a multi-stage pipeline, **never** open with a numbered/bulleted list of stages followed by prose that re-explains the same stages. The list adds nothing the prose doesn't already convey, and it fragments the narrative into disconnected labels before the reader has any context for them.

Instead, write a single flowing paragraph (or a few short paragraphs) that introduces the system and walks through each stage in sequence, so the reader builds understanding incrementally. Each stage should connect causally to the next — the output of one becomes the input of another.

## Bad

```markdown
1. **Capture Layer** — Drop-in pandas replacement module, operation tracer
2. **Logical Plan** — IR, operation nodes
3. **Translator** — Converts algebra, optimization pass
4. **Execution** — Sheet layout, formula definitions

Fornero is a drop-in replacement for pandas…
```

The list front-loads jargon with no explanation, then the paragraph restarts from scratch.

## Good

```markdown
Fornero is a drop-in replacement for pandas… every DataFrame carries a
tree of operation nodes — the logical plan — that captures the full
lineage of transformations. When the user materialises a spreadsheet, a
translator walks this tree and converts each operation into concrete
cell ranges and formulas. The result is an execution plan that a Sheets
executor applies via batched API calls.
```

One narrative, no redundancy, each stage motivated by the previous one.

## No section numbers

Do not prefix headings with numbers (e.g., "## 1. Architecture Overview", "### Component 3: Translator"). Headings should stand on their own — the document's structure already communicates order through heading hierarchy and sequencing. Numbered headings add visual clutter and create maintenance burden when sections are reordered.

## No horizontal-rule separators between sections

Do not place `---` horizontal rules between sections. Headings already provide clear visual separation. Adding rules creates excessive whitespace and makes the document feel disjointed rather than continuous.

## Use direct verbs, not stilted constructions

Prefer "X does Y" over roundabout phrasing like "X operates through Y", "X is responsible for Y", or "X provides the capability of Y". The subject should act.

**Bad:** "Fornero operates through dual-mode execution."
**Good:** "Fornero executes every operation in two modes simultaneously."

**Bad:** "The translator is responsible for converting each node."
**Good:** "The translator converts each node."

**Bad:** "This class provides the functionality to track plans."
**Good:** "This class tracks plans."
